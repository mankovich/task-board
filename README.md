# 05 Task Board

## Description of Application 

The application is a task board that is supposed to allow a team to manage project tasks by displaying them in columns representing the state of progress--not yet started, in progress, and done. A card is created for each task, containing the task title, description, and due date. The cards will be automatically color coded based on time remaining to due date.
